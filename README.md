# Huawei In-App Purchase-Kit

Huawei's In-App Purchases (IAP) service allows you to offer in-app purchases and facilitates in-app payment. Users can purchase a variety of virtual products, including one-time virtual products and subscriptions, directly within your app.

HUAWEI IAP provides a product management system (PMS) for managing the prices and languages of in-app products (including games) in multiple locations. You only need to release one app package to promote your app in locations listed in Supported Locations.

The latest version supports the following functions:

1) Release: You can release an app or a game with one package and manage the prices and languages of in-app purchases. The locations supported by the PMS on the price configuration page shall prevail.
2) Currencies and languages: You can set one default currency and one default language for each location. Setting multiple languages for one location is not allowed.
3) Price: Huawei provides an in-app product price reference for each location based on the converted price (tax included) you set and the exchange rate. You can change the price.
4) Exchange rate: fixed exchange rate by which Huawei will update the price. Updating the exchange rate by Huawei will not affect your price if you do not change the price.
5) Intended audience: global developers. To release an in-app product (or a game) to multiple locations, you need to manage the price and language of the products locally.

# Features
1) Easy access and sandbox testing.
Comprehensive access procedure guidance and sandbox testing configuration are provided so that you can quickly and easily access HUAWEI IAP.

2) Localized languages and currencies for a convenient worldwide release.
Localized languages and currencies are displayed for in-app purchases based on the locations where users are located. All you have to do is just releasing a package.

3) Multiple payment methods are aggregated for global payments.
Users can pay with bank cards, Alipay, WeChat, Direct Carrier Billing (DCB), and HUAWEI Points. The bank cards include those issued by major banks in China as well as Visa and Mastercard. DCB is supported by many large carriers outside China. Users can bind their bank cards and phone numbers to their HUAWEI IDs and make payments by entering payment passwords they have set before, which is more convenient than traditional payment methods.
